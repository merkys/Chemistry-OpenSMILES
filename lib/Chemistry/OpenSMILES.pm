=head1 NAME

Chemistry::OpenSMILES - OpenSMILES format reader and writer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser;

    my $parser = Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser->new;
    my @moieties = $parser->parse( 'C#C.c1ccccc1' );

    $\ = "\n";
    for my $moiety (@moieties) {
        #  $moiety is a Graph::Undirected object
        print scalar $moiety->vertices;
        print scalar $moiety->edges;
    }

    use Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Writer qw(write_SMILES);

    print write_SMILES( \@moieties );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Chemistry::OpenSMILES provides support for SMILES chemical identifiers
conforming to OpenSMILES v1.0 specification
(L<http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html>).

Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser reads in SMILES strings and returns them
parsed to arrays of L<Graph::Undirected|Graph::Undirected> objects. Each
atom is represented by a hash.

Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Writer performs the inverse operation. Generated
SMILES strings are by no means optimal.

=head2 Molecular graph

Disconnected parts of a compound are represented as separate
L<Graph::Undirected|Graph::Undirected> objects. Atoms are represented
as vertices, and bonds are represented as edges.

=head3 Atoms

Atoms, or vertices of a molecular graph, are represented as hash
references:

    {
        "symbol"    => "C",
        "isotope"   => 13,
        "chirality" => "@@",
        "hcount"    => 3,
        "charge"    => 1,
        "class"     => 0,
        "number"    => 0,
    }

Except for C<symbol>, C<class> and C<number>, all keys of hash are
optional. Per OpenSMILES specification, default values for C<hcount>
and C<class> are 0.

For chiral atoms, the order of its neighbours in input is preserved in
an array added as value for C<chirality_neighbours> key of the atom hash.

=head3 Bonds

Bonds, or edges of a molecular graph, rely completely on
L<Graph::Undirected|Graph::Undirected> internal representation. Bond
orders other than single (C<->, which is also a default) are represented
as values of edge attribute C<bond>. They correspond to the symbols used
in OpenSMILES specification.

=head2 Options

C<parse> accepts the following options for key-value pairs in an
anonymous hash for its second parameter:

=over

=item C<max_hydrogen_count_digits>

In OpenSMILES specification the number of attached hydrogen atoms for
atoms in square brackets is limited to 9. IUPAC SMILES+ has increased
this number to 99. With the value of C<max_hydrogen_count_digits> the
parser could be instructed to allow other than 1 digit for attached
hydrogen count.

=item C<raw>

With C<raw> set to anything evaluating to true, the parser will not
convert neither implicit nor explicit hydrogen atoms in square brackets
to atom hashes of their own. Moreover, it will not attempt to unify the
representations of chirality. It should be noted, though, that many of
subroutines of Chemistry::OpenSMILES expect non-raw data structures,
thus processing raw output may produce distorted results.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

Element symbols in square brackets are not limited to the ones known to
chemistry. Currently any single or two-letter symbol is allowed.

Deprecated charge notations (C<--> and C<++>) are supported.

OpenSMILES specification mandates a strict order of ring bonds and
branches:

    branched_atom ::= atom ringbond* branch*

Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser supports both the mandated, and inverted
structure, where ring bonds follow branch descriptions.

Whitespace is not supported yet. SMILES descriptors must be cleaned of
it before attempting reading with Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser.

The derivation of implicit hydrogen counts for aromatic atoms is not
unambiguously defined in the OpenSMILES specification. Thus only
aromatic carbon is accounted for as if having valence of 3.

Chiral atoms with three neighbours are interpreted as having a lone
pair of electrons as the fourth chiral neighbour. The lone pair is
always understood as being the second in the order of neighbour
enumeration, except when the atom with the lone pair starts a chain. In
that case lone pair is the first.
