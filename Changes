    - Adding Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Writer, implementing a SMILES writer
      for the data structures built by Chemistry::OpenSMILES::Parser.
    - Converting 'charge' atom field to integer.
    - Exporting Chemistry::OpenSMILES::is_aromatic().

0.3.2 2020-10-05

    - Explicitly setting bond order to ':' on bonds between aromatic
      atoms.

    - Establishing deterministic order while generating graph vertices
      for implicit hydrogen atoms.

0.3.0 2020-09-16

    - Deriving counts of implicit hydrogen atoms.
    - Default number of attached hydrogen atoms for atoms in square
      brackets is 0.
    - Supporting bracketless '*' atom.

0.2.1 2020-08-13

    - Adding 'number' atom field to store atom positions in the initial
      SMILES string.
    - Making 'class' atom field mandatory.
    - Making 'isotope' atom field an integer.

0.2.0 2020-05-20

    - Declaring minimum Perl version.
    - Fixing the POD.

0.1.2 2020-05-17
